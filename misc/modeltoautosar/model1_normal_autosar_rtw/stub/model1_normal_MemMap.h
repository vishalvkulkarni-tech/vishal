/* This file contains stub implementations of the AUTOSAR RTE functions.
   The stub implementations can be used for testing the generated code in
   Simulink, for example, in SIL/PIL simulations of the component under
   test. Note that this file should be replaced with an appropriate RTE
   file when deploying the generated code outside of Simulink.
